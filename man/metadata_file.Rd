\title{The Metadata File}
\arguments{
\item{expName}{The name of the experiment. This will be used in many plot 
titles and as a first part of the name of saved PDFs.}

\item{filetype}{Character length one. The filetype of the raw-data file. 
Leave at "def" to get the default from the settings 
(parameter \code{imp_specFileType}). If a value other than "def" is provided 
in the argument "filetype" in "getFullData", this is overriding the value of 
"filetype" in the metadata file. Please refer to the help for "getFullData" 
for possible values.}

\item{noiseFileName}{The name of the corresponding noise-data file residing 
in the AQUAP2SH folder. Leave at 'def' to get the default from the settings 
(parameter 'noi_noiseDataFilename'). If a value other than "def" is provided 
in the argument 'noiseFile' in the function 'gdmm', this is overriding the 
value of 'noiseFileName' here in the metadata file. Please refer to the help 
for ?noise_procedures for more information.}

\item{tempCalibFileName}{The name of the corresponding temperature-data file 
residing in the AQUAP2SH folder. Leave at 'def' to get the default from the 
settings (parameter 'aqg_tempCalib_Filename'). If a value other than "def" 
is provided in the argument 'tempFile' in the function 'gdmm', this is 
overriding the value of 'tempCalibFileName' here in the metadata file. Please 
refer to the help for ?tempCalib_procedures for more information.}

\item{commonValue}{Character. A value that will be be present in all the rows 
 of the dataset. The default 'def' reads in the default value from the 
settings.r file. (Parameter \code{p_commonNoSplit}.)}

\item{xaxDenominator}{The unit that is displayed on the x-axis when 
plotting e.g. raw spectra.}

\item{yaxDenominator}{The unit that is displayed on the y-axis when 
plotting e.g. raw spectra.}

\item{TimePoints}{Logical 'FALSE' or a character vector. Leave at 'FALSE' if 
your experiment does not cover more than one point in time, otherwise provide 
a label for each time-point in the format c("T0", "T1", "T2", ...) or leave 
at 'FALSE' for no time-splitting.}

\item{nrConScans}{Numeric length one. The number of consecutive scans for each 
sample.}

\item{spacing}{Numeric length one. The number of "real measurements" between 
each "environmental control", i.e. the "space" between environmental control 
samples (set to \code{FALSE} for not inserting environmental controls).}

\item{envControlLabel}{Character. The label for the enironmental control. 
The default 'def' reads in the default value from the settings.r file.}

\item{realMeasurementLabel}{Character. The label for the "real measurements". 
The default 'def' reads in the default value from the settings.r file.}

\item{columnNamesL1}{Character vector. The column names for the L1-variables.}

\item{columnNamesL2}{Character vector. The column names for the L2-variables, 
they have to have the same length as the L1 column names.}

\item{L1}{A list, containing a list for each L1-variable.}

\item{L2}{A list, containing a list for each L2-variable.}

\item{Repls}{Numeric. How many replicates of each sample to measure. The values 
in the dataset wil be prefixed with the default character for the replicates, 
which can be set in the settings (default is "R"). So, with e.g. three 
replicates you will find the values "R1", "R2", and "R3" in the dataset.}

\item{Group}{Character vector. Additional groups to split the above generated 
classes into, like e.g. experiment and control. Please see details.}

\description{
The metadata file contains all the metadata of an experiment 
like experiment name etc. It is also used to design the experiment and 
to export a randomized sample list that then can be used in the data 
 acquisition process. Additionally, the references to the temperature 
calibration file (necessary for plotting Aquagrams) and to the file containing 
the noise-spectra are kept here.
}
\details{
For examples on the use of the arguments \code{columnNamesL1}, 
\code{columnNamesL2}, \code{L1} and \code{L2} please refer to the example 
metadata files provided in the root-folder of this package. (Type 
\code{path.package("aquap2")}, then go there and look at and try out the 
files in \code{examples/metadata}.)
