\title{Calculate Aquagram - Modes}
\description{
The following values can be provided to the argument \code{aqg.mod} 
in \code{getap}, specifiying what type of Aquagram should be calculated.

\section{Possible Values}{
 Possible Aquagram modes are
\itemize{
\item \code{classic}: The classical aquagram - smoothed, MSC, normalized
\item \code{classic-diff}: same as above + one group subtracted from all the
others. 
\item \code{sfc}: "Scaled, foreign center": smoothed, MSC, centered on the mean of
selected calibration data, scaled. 
\item \code{sfc-diff}: same as above + one group subtracted from all the others.
\item \code{aucs}: "Area Under Curve Stabilized": the area under the curve (auc)
from the spectra in all the 12/15 coordinates in a set of calibration data
at varying temperature is calculated, then divided by the total auc. Then
the smalles and biggest value is taken as 0% and 100%. The same auc is
calculated for every sample, and its value in percent ... XXX 
\item \code{aucs-diff}: same as above + one group subtracted from all the others. 
\item \code{aucs.tn}: aucs + temperature normalization: .... XXX the auc from a
sample at Texp gets subtracted from all the auc of the samples. 
\item \code{aucs.tn-diff}: same as above + one group subtracted from all the
others
\item \code{aucs.tn.dce}: same as aucs.tn, but the scale calculated to show
degrees celsius equivalent
\item \code{aucs.tn.dce-diff}: same as above + one group subtracted from all the
others
\item \code{aucs.dce}: same as aucs, but the scale calculated to show degrees
celsius equivalent
\item \code{aucs.dce-diff}: same as above + one group subtracted from all the
others
