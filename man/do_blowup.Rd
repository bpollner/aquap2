\title{Increase the Numbers of Observation in Dataset}
\usage{
do_blowup(
  dataset,
  grp = NULL,
  tn = "x10",
  an = "100\%",
  cst = TRUE,
  conf = TRUE,
  pred = TRUE,
  replace = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{An object of class 'aquap_data' as produced e.g. by 
\code{\link{gfd}}.}

\item{grp}{Character. One ore more valid class-variable names that should be 
used to from subgroups within the dataset. Similar to the \code{spl.var} 
argument in the analysis procedure.}

\item{tn}{Numeric or character length one. If numeric, \code{tn} is denoting 
the target-number, i.e. the desired number of observations in the expanded 
dataset. If a grouping is provided via \code{grp}, the target number is 
defining the desired number of observations within each subgroup obtained 
by the grouping. If \code{tn} is a character it hast to be in the format 
\code{xN}, with \code{N} being a positive integer. In this case it means 
an N-fold increase of the dataset resp. of each subgroup as defined by the 
grouping in \code{grp}. Defaults to \code{x10}.}

\item{an}{Numeric or character length one. If numeric, \code{an} is denoting 
the "average-number", i.e. the number of observations resp. their spectra that 
should be drawn (with replacement) from the dataset resp. from the respective 
subgroup. These drawn samples then are averaged together into a new spectrum. 
If \code{an} is a character it has to be in the format \code{N\%}, with 
\code{N} being a positive integer. In this case it denotes the percentage of 
observations in the dataset resp. in each of the subgroups possibly obtained 
via \code{grp} that should be drawn (with replacement) and averaged together 
into a new observation. Defaults to \code{100\%}, what is the recommended value.}

\item{cst}{Logical. If consecutive scans should always be kept together. 
NOT YET IMPLEMENTED - value is ignored, and consec. scans are NOT kept together.}

\item{conf}{Logical. If numbers should be presented and confirmation requested 
before commencing the actual calculations.}

\item{pred}{Logical. If an estimation of the number of identical spectra should 
be made. Only presented if \code{conf} is TRUE.}

\item{replace}{Logical. If the sample drawing should be done with replacement.
Recommended value is TRUE.}
}
\value{
The dataset with increased numbers of observations.
}
\description{
Use random observations of the provided dataset (within a possible 
grouping), calculate their average and add the resulting spectrum as new 
observation to the dataset.
}
\details{
The random observations are sampled with replacement. The provenience 
of each observation is marked in an additional column in the header named 
`blowup`, where the character `orig` denotes an original observation, while the 
character `artif` is marking an artificially generated observation.
}
\section{Warning}{
 Do take care of a correct grouping, otherwise the inclusion 
of observations into the same group that do not belong together will destroy
any information.
