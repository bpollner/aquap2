## Course Material
### Japan 2018
The repository [aquap2_courseMaterial](https://github.com/bpollner/aquap2_courseMaterial) contains a demo dataset with some exploratory and quantitative data analysis steps designed to give a first impression of some of the functions of aquap2.
This is the same demo-dataset as handed out at [The 3rd Aquaphotomics Symposium](http://conference.aquaphotomics.com/) in Japan in December 2018.

### Rome 2023
